Finnish language is hard. We come from "Mäntyharju_lta_" or "Hiekkaharju_sta_". 
We spend our time "Lahde_ssa_" or "Kesälahde_lla_". This is a first trial to make things better and to help with at least the common cities/places.

## Howto
`npm run test`
 (in the future this hopefully is available as an npm package.)

## How to contribute
1. Write a test case in test/index.js
2. Write a rule in index.js in the appropriate line
